# On my BookShelf

#### Description:

My first idea was to make a tik tak toe that we saw during a class but since it was already done 
I decided to choose something else. Then I wanted to do a Chrome extention but I really wanted to 
use the presentation language HTML and Bootstrap. 

I first thought about making a TO DO LIST application but it was already common and thus wasn't 
useful. Since I'm working in a library I thus thouhgt that an application gathering every books 
I have read could be interesting.

OnMyBookShelf is a web application that allows users to list their reading in a dynamic board. 

After filling in the “Title”, “Author” and “Rating” fields, the book is saved on the board and
can be deleted later. 
An alert will appear when the book is saved and when it is removed.
Thanks to a search bar, users can find a book with the title, the author or its rating out of 
five.

If one field is not filled in, an alert will appear and the book won’t be added into the board.
In order to avoid ending up with a too long web page, the board is contained within a <div>. 
A vertical scrollbar allows you to scroll through the books of the board.

I used the HTML and Javascript languages for this project. I learned to use Bootstrap in order 
to make the application responsive and to standardize the design on the index.html file.
I was able to implement the icons present in the web application with Fontawesome. The final 
visual result is what I was looking for. 

All the texts are in white, even those of the board. I thought about adding a “Comments” field  
but I wanted to keep the application as succinct as possible. 
I considered that the “Note” field would fulfill this function.

I had some difficulties to get the desired results with the use of Javaspcrit on the app.js file 
but it was a good challenge. 

What was really important to me was that the fields that had to be filled in were appearing 
correctly in the board and that if one field was missing, nothing would happen. 

The search bar was easier to implement than I expected.

I also worked on adding a “Pile of books to read” page affiliated to the My BookShelf application 
but I didn’t achieve the desired result. 
Thus, I chose to hand in a slightly less sophisticated but neater project. 

In order to get to this application idea, I went through several other ideas but they were either 
too simple or too complex. 

I created several folders in the IDE in order to develop many ideas in parallel, and the handed 
version is the most successful one.
